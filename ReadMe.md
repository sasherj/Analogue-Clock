# **Analogue Clock - JavaScript Project**

This project is a simple **analogue clock** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The clock displays the current time with rotating **hour**, **minute**, and **second hands**. The clock's hands rotate smoothly, and the time is updated every second based on the system's clock.

## **Features**

- **Real-time Clock**: Displays the current time using rotating hour, minute, and second hands.
- **Responsive Design**: The clock adjusts its size based on the screen size, making it adaptable for various devices.
- **Smooth Rotation**: The clock hands rotate smoothly every second, simulating a real-world analogue clock.

## **Components**

- **HTML**: Structures the clock, including the clock face and hands (hour, minute, second).
- **CSS**: Styles the clock's appearance, including the clock hands, face, and center.
- **JavaScript**: Updates the position of the clock hands every second, using the system's current time.

## **How It Works**

1. **HTML**: The basic structure includes the clock container and three hands (hour, minute, second).
2. **CSS**: The clock's face is styled with a background image and circular shape. The hands are positioned at the center using absolute positioning and rotated around their bottom end.
3. **JavaScript**: Every second, the clock hands are rotated based on the current time, calculated from the systemâ€™s clock. The `setInterval()` function ensures the hands are updated in real-time.

## **Project Use Cases**

1. **Real-time Analog Clock**: Displays the current time in an intuitive analogue clock format.
2. **Web Development Practice**: Great for practicing **JavaScript** timing functions (`setInterval()`), **CSS** animations, and **HTML5** positioning techniques.
3. **Responsive Design Learning**: The clock is built to be responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
